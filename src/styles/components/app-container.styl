    WARNING: '#app-container' and '#app-container > div' will not stretch to fit
    their content. This doesn't affect the layout of elements across browsers,
    but it does affect backgrounds. Do not use CSS background here; place
    background in either body or .content-section.

    /*
    WARNING: Adding padding to #app-container or #app-container > div will cause
    certain content, e.g. maps, to fail to "stretch fully" into the container.
    Please check with design before adding paddings/margins here.
