# Container Components

- Are concerned with how things work.
- May contain both presentational and container components inside but usually donâ€™t have any DOM markup of their own except for some wrapping divs, and never have any styles.
- Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components.
- Call Flux actions and provide these as callbacks to dumb components.
- Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources.
- Are usually generated using higher order components such as `connect()` from React Redux, `createContainer()` from Relay, or `Container.create()` from Flux Utils, rather than written by hand.
- Examples: UserPage, FollowersSidebar, StoryContainer, FollowedUserList.
